Under prof Partha Pratim Chakraborti,Department of Computer Science,IIT Kharagpur

•Designed a Multi Vehicle path optimization system for Electric Vehicles in a very unique and basic way.


•Applied Djikstra,A* and other admissible heuristic algorithms to find the optimal paths of system of vehicles


•Formalized a working schedule under constraints that minimizes the time to complete all tasks of the system


•Developed both admissible optimal as well as heuristic algorithms that works for system of EVs across all kind of network of cities.
